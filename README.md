Automated miniature soap factory, expertly integrating dispensing, conveying, and processing 
stages. Utilizing hoppers for raw materials, an array of sensors for precise control, and multiple motor drivers 
for actuation, the system demonstrates a streamlined production line. The clearly labeled wiring and motor 
drivers indicate a well-structured control system, making this an excellent prototype for illustrating 
automated manufacturing principles in a simplified yet effective manner
